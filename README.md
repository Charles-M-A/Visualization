# Visualization
An interactive data visualisation dashboard built using Tableau to understand or make sense of the data provided by Barnet Youth foundation.

Developed as a part of the coursework for the module CST4055 Data Visualisation at Middlesex University, London during the academic year 2019-20._

I am not allowed to share the project or its details so only a sample dashboard is provided.
